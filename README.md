- 👋 Hi, I’m @ReneeNowak
- 👀 I’m interested in culinary, nature, and my cat Khajiit
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to avoid slamming my head against walls when frustrated with course work
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... not much.
- 📫 How to reach me - please don't.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: The Female anglerfish "obtains" males and gradually their bodies disintegrate until the female is left with an additional pair of testicles.
- With my dating experiences so far, I respect the anglerfish greatly.
